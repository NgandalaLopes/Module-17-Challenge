# Regex Tutorial for URL matching.

A regular expression (regex or regexp) is a pattern of characters that describe a set of strings. It is a powerful tool used for searching and manipulating text, and can be used in various programming languages, text editors, and other applications.

A regular expression can include literal characters (such as letter and numbers), special characters (such as * and +), and meta-characters (such as as \d for any digit and \s for any whitespace character).
These can be combined in various ways to create complex patterns that can match a wide range of strings.

Regular expressions are commonly used for tasks such as validating input data, searching and replacing text, and extracting data from text. They can be very powerfull and felexible, but can also be difficult to write and debug, expecially for complex patterns.


## Example:

```regexp
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/ 
```

**Explanation:**

-`/` Begins Regex
-`^` This is always at the begining of the string, to position the anchors.
-`(` Groups together multiple "tokens" to create a capture group. This can be used to retrieve a substring or backreference.
-`https` This indicates a sub-expression string that should be matched. "s"
- `?` This is a Greedy quantifier, which is basically denoting 0 or 1 occurrence of previous character (s) either http or https
^^ not 100% on this, pretty sure it takes a way the 's' from http
- `\/\/` This is an escaped character 
- `)` This Ends the capture grouped.
- `?` Greedy quaintifier indicating the entire previous section wrapped in () is optional. You can have it or not.
- `(` Begins captured group.
- `[` Begins bracket list.
- `/d` Is a metacharacter indicating any one digit character (0-9)
- `a-z` Indicates lower case letters between a-z.
- `\.` Escape sequence denoting the character `.`
- `-` Indicates `-` character
- `]` Ends bracket list.
- `+` Because its outside the brackets the Greedy quantifier is denoting that the previous bracket list characters, may occur one or more times.
- `)` Ends captured group.
- `\.` Escape sequence denoting the character `.`
- `(` Begins captured group.
- `[` Begins bracket list.
- `a-z.` Indicates lower case letters between a-z.
- `]` Ends bracket list.
`{2,6}` Occurence indicator denoting the previous bracket list characters may occur from 2 to 6 times.
- `)` Ends captured group.
- `(` Begins captured group.
- `[` Begins bracket list.
- `/` Escapes regex to match the character `/`
- `\w` Is a character class indicating any dingle Word Characters. Those are any characters including a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _.
- `.` Escape sequence denoting the character `.`
- `-` Indicates `-` character
- `]` Ends bracket list.
- `*` The Greedy quantifier denoting that the previous bracket list characters may occur zero or more times
- `)` Ends captured group.
- `*` Greedy quantifier indicating that the entire previous captured group may occur zero or more times.
- `/` Escapes regex to denote a regular `/` character
- `?` Greedy quantifier indicating previous `/` character may have 0 or 1 occurrences.
- `$` Position acnhoring that ends the string.
- `/` Ends Regex.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The Anchors are always at the begining and end of the string. For the example above, `^` is the symbol for the begining and `$` is for the end.

```text
^               Matches any string that starts with
$               Matches a string that ends with 
```


### Quantifiers

Quantifiers communicate to the regex engine that it MUST match the Quanity of the character or expression to its LEFT. 
There are two types of Quantifiers; Greedy and Lazy, each type has the same description.
- `* and *? `           Matches Zero or more times. 
- `+ and +? `           Matches One or more times.
- `? and ?? `           Matches Zero or One times.
- `{n} and {n}? `       Matches exactly n times.
- `{n,} and {n,}?  `    Matches atleast n times.
- `{n,m} and {n,m}? `   Matches from n to m times.

Examples include:

```text
https?          Because of the `?` Matches 'https', 'http'. 
[\da-z\.-]+     Because of the `+` it matches a single digit, group of letters (a-z), dot (.) or hyphen (-) 1 or more times
[a-z\.]{2,6}    Because of the `{2,6}` it matches 2 to 6 copies of the sequence [a-z\.]
[\/\w \.-]*     Because of the `*` it matches '/', '.', '-', 'www', '//'
```

### Character Classes

Character Classes ensure that a given sequence of characters matches a Larger set of characters. 


```text
[a-z]          Matches lowercase alphabetic characters between a and z
\w             Matches a single word
\d             Matches a single character that is a digit 0-9
.              Matches any character
```

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping expressions allows us to keep things more organized and easier to exact the characters of a given group. This is used with parentheses "()".

```text
(https?:\/\/)     This group is basically saying it allows the URL code to being with "http://", "https://" or none of them.
([\da-z\.-]+)     This group which is the domain name. It matches 1 or more numbers, letters, dots or hypens. Ending it with a "+" linking it to the following line.
([a-z\.]{2,6})    Withe the + connecting this group together, this matches 2-6 copies of the sequences "[a-z\.]"
([\/\w \.-]*)     This group is is being matched as many times as they want because of the "*" at the end. 

```

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are expressions between "[]" brackets. In the example above, we have the following Bracket Expressions.

```text
[\da-z\.-]
[a-z\.]
[\/\w \.-]
```

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy and Lazy Quantifers allow you to find the Greedy and the Lazy match. "Greedy" being the longest. "Lazy" being the shortest.

```text
([\da-z\.-]+)       The "+" operator is greedy as it allows character matching from one to an infinite amount of times.
```

## User Story

```text
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```text
